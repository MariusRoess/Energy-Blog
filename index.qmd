Hi there, my name is Marius. This my blog.

## What I plan to do
I am not an energy expert, but i have always been interested in the energy transition. And I have often found that certain concepts are not explained or not even discussed so I want to try to add to the discussion. I am always interested to learn new skills like websites and visualization of concepts. Maybe I will also produce Youtube to further my arguments.
