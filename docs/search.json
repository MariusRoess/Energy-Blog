    "text": "Investment decision\nSo whenever we talk about building a new powerplant we have basically two kind of costs:\n\nHuge upfront costs at the beginning of the project, the investment costs. We assume they are all made in the first year and we scale them to the unit of kilowatt so we divide the total investment cost by the name plate capacity (rated capacity) of the powerplant in kW.\n(Fixed) recurring costs for the operational life of the plant. For thermal powerplants that burn stuff this the usual the cost of fuel (nuclear plant burn fuel as well). We want to look at the fuel cost again scaled to kW. Then these costs are simply the full load hours (see below) times the inverse of the efficiency of the powerplant (heat rate) times the price for the fuel per kWh.\n\nObviously renewable producers such as solar and wind don’t come with fuel cost.\nOther recurring costs are staff cost, scheduled maintance and there are cost at the end of the lifetime (decommissiong costs). These are mentioned in the wiki formula for LCOE but we want to assume that they can be subsummized under investment cost and ignore them further.\nThough we should keep in mind the cost of pollution allowance, the infamous CO2-tax. Since the amount of CO2 is related to the energy content of the fuel we can easily include this in the fuel price.\nAdditionaly every material good like a powerplant wears down over time. So we have an expected lifetime after which the investment has to be recouped by the earning of the sale of electricity.\nImportantly we assume that the fuel price and the sale price of electricity (lcoe) remain constant over the lifetime!"

    "text": "Annuity factor\nHow do we now make the total cost (investment and recurring) comparable and how do the earnings over the lifetime factor in?\n\neither we find the net present value of the recurring costs and add it to the investemnt costs and compare that to the net present value of the earnings\nor we convert the investment cost to an annuity and add it to the yearly recurring costs and compare that to the yearly earnings\n\nThe connector between a one time payment and a paymend of a constant amount over a predetermined time fram (fixed cash flow) is the annuity factor. Multiply a fixed cash flow with it and you get the net present value. Divide an initial investement amount by it and you know what amount money has to be paid yearly for the prescribed years to offset the initial costs.\n    \n        \n            Discount rate %: \n            \n            Years: \n            \n            Annuity Factor: \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \nAs you play around with it you’ll notice how the discount reduces the annuity factor. That is because it makes payments way out in the future less valuable.\nOff course this formula only works when you assuem fixed payments. So we will further assume that the fuel price and the sale price of electricity (lcoe) does not change over time, so no inflation. One way of including a fixed rate of inflation is to the reduce the discount rate, take what is known as real interest rate."
